# LateralEngine

# Dependencies 
	
	In the external folder you need to put glfw,
	glm, and the vulkan header folder. Without these
	CMAKE will not be able to compile your dir

# Building
	
	Using CMAKE you can configure a custom build
	for your operating system. The code should
	be able to be built on every system, due to
	not using platform-specific code.

# Contact
	
	If you would like to contact me, either use a
	pull request or send me an email.
